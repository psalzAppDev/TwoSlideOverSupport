### Renaming Documents
By "renaming," we mean renaming the filename. Your users don't see this -- this is just for your organization and for SupportDocs to [order](#ordering-documents) your documents.

Renaming is the same as any other file hosted on GitHub. Just select it, click the edit icon, and enter a new name. Don't forget to <kbd>Commit changes</kbd> to save.

### Ordering Documents
SupportDocs sorts your documents alphabetically (A-Z) by filename, which is never shown to the user. You can see the order of your documents inside the **Table of Contents** section in your **DataSource** branch.

To rearrange your documents, just rename their filenames so that they'll appear in the order that you want.

### Deleting Documents
Select the document to delete, then just click on the trash icon in the top-right corner.
